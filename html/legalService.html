                                    We offer comprehensive advice for both procurement and resolving disputes. Clients of our practice encompass the entire development spectrum of developers, financiers, contractors, major sub-contractors and project consultants. Our services embrace major project work, including infrastructure and commercial development. We have negotiated and advised upon some of the major projects in the UAE – from pre-tender stage right through to project completion. We frequently advise in relation to major retail, leisure, residential and office developments. We assist our clients – be they employers, contractors or consultants – on all aspects of contract interpretation and procedures during the course of projects. Our Firm also provides explicit consultation on FIDIC (The International Federation of Consulting Engineers) contracts in UAE, as well as drafting such a contract most suitable for your situation and your contracting party by adding the necessary provisions under UAE law and eliminating those which are disadvantageous.       </p>
